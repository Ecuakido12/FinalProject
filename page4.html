        <p> In the end, I hope that this informational guide will be update in the future to encourage more people to become aware of their community. Becuase if we all work together and keepig our community clean then we can make positive impact for all of us. And not also the communtiy but to aslo be aware of the risks o having our trash collect in shorlines located near ocean,rivers, or lackes. The ecosytem is important for the world and for us too.<p>
